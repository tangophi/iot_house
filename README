This repo contains the following:

1. node-red-flows: node-red flow for managing various IoT boards in my house. 
   It does this by receiving/sending MQTT messages from/to various boards 
   as well as socket messages from a NetIO based smartphone app.  It also 
   acts as an interface to send data to thingspeak.com and to send tweets.

2. NetIO app: the json file in this folder is the config for the NetIO based
   smartphone app used to control the various IoT boards.

node-red:
=========
The flows_pi2.json file should be copied to /home/pi/.node-red folder.  Of course,
node-red needs to be installed.

How to install node-red
=======================
1. Install nodejs.  The standard packages dont work.  Only the one below works.
  http://conoroneill.net//download-compiled-version-of-nodejs-0120-stable-for-raspberry-pi-here
 
2. Install node-red
  /usr/local/bin/npm install -g node-red

The above steps to install node-red on a Rpi2 may change with time.


NetIO:
======
The json file can be imported into the NetIO UI Designer (http://netio.davideickhoff.de/editor)
using the Upload button at the top of the window.  It can then be customised for your needs.


IoT Boards:
===========
Detailed instructables have been created for the following IoT boards in my house.  More
instructables about the other boards will be done in the near future.

Changelog:

May 08, 2016
============
* More boards have been added.
* The fourth board is a just a helper console for the fifth board.  It also has a servo to lift/retract
  the 2.4 inch TFT display mounted under the TV.  It has another servo to block/unblock the IR receiver 
  of the media player.
* The fifth board is a ATMEGA1284p/ESP8266 based project to control lighting as well as ceiling fan.
  It also has an IR blaster that can be used to control TV, Soundbar.
  There is a IR receiver attached to the raspberry pi.  When the media player's remote is used, the 
  raspberry pi detects the signals and sends it to the fifth board.  Then depending on which functionality
  is selected, it will either send IR signals to the TV or the sound bar or control the lighting and
  other stuff.

=============
* Four boards are managed at the moment.
* Details of the first board can be found at
  http://www.instructables.com/id/An-inexpensive-IoT-enabler-using-ESP8266/

* The second board is a Arduino Pro Mini/ESP8266/WS281B based mood lighting project
  in the living room.

* The third board is a ATMEGA1284P/ESP8266 based project that uses relays with
  modified off-the-shelf power strips to act as a Network Power Switch.
