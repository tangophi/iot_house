This repo contains the node-red flow for managing various IoT boards in a house.
It does this by getting/sending MQTT messages from/to various boards as well as
socket messages from a NetIO based smartphone app.  It also acts as an interface
to send data to thingspeak.com and to send tweets.

The flows_pi2.json file should be copied to /home/pi/.node-red folder.  Of course,
node-red needs to be installed.

How to install node-red
=======================
1. Install nodejs.  The standard packages dont work.  Only the one below works.
  http://conoroneill.net//download-compiled-version-of-nodejs-0120-stable-for-raspberry-pi-here
 
2. Install node-red
  /usr/local/bin/npm install -g node-red

The above steps to install node-red on a Rpi2 may change with time.
