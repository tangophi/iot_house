This repo contains the node-red flow for managing various IoT boards in a house.
It does this by getting/sending MQTT messages from/to various boards as well as
socket messages from a NetIO based smartphone app.  It also acts as an interface
to send data to thingspeak.com and to send tweets.

The flows_pi2.json file should be copied to /home/pi/.node-red folder.  Of course,
node-red needs to be installed.

How to install node-red
=======================
1. Install nodejs.  The standard packages dont work.  Only the one below works.
  http://conoroneill.net//download-compiled-version-of-nodejs-0120-stable-for-raspberry-pi-here
 
2. Install node-red
  /usr/local/bin/npm install -g node-red

The above steps to install node-red on a Rpi2 may change with time.

============
* More boards have been added.
* The fourth board is a just a helper console for the fifth board.  It also has a servo to lift/retract
  the 2.4 inch TFT display mounted under the TV.  It has another servo to block/unblock the IR receiver 
  of the media player.
* The fifth board is a ATMEGA1284p/ESP8266 based project to control lighting as well as ceiling fan.
  It also has an IR blaster that can be used to control TV, Soundbar.
  There is a IR receiver attached to the raspberry pi.  When the media player's remote is used, the 
  raspberry pi detects the signals and sends it to the fifth board.  Then depending on which functionality
  is selected, it will either send IR signals to the TV or the sound bar or control the lighting and
  other stuff.

=============
* Four boards are managed at the moment.
* Details of the first board can be found at
  http://www.instructables.com/id/An-inexpensive-IoT-enabler-using-ESP8266/

* The second board is a Arduino Pro Mini/ESP8266/WS281B based mood lighting project
  in the living room.

* The third board is a ATMEGA1284P/ESP8266 based project that uses relays with
  modified off-the-shelf power strips to act as a Network Power Switch.
